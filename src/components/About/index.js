                        I am a results-driven marketing director with 10-plus years’ experience of 
                        innovation, branding, communications and outreach. I have a strong track 
                        record driving revenue through the management of cross-functional creative, 
                        research and operational teams. In addition, I believe that my determination, 
                        organization and will power allows me to work in fast paced environments. My 
                        career up to this point has always provided challenging tasks, but it has been 
                        a joy at the same time. I’ve worked with very talented people and it’s always 
                        pushed me to become better at my craft.
